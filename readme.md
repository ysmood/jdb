# Overview

This project aims to create a flexible database that won't try to create any weird syntax or rules.
Just few APIs will make everything work smoothly.
It is an append-only in-memory database.
It uses json to decrease javascript commands.

# Features

* Super fast ([see the benchmark](#benchmarks)).

* Light weight.

* Promise support.

* Use full functioned javascript to operate your data, no steep learning curve.

* Make debugging inside the data possible.

* Support both standalone mode (server) and in-application mode (lib).


# Quick start

### Installation

Install `jdb` first.

    npm install jdb

### Examples

```coffeescript

jdb = new (require 'jdb') { promise: true }


# The data to play with.
some_data = {
    "name": {
        "first": "Yad"
        "last": "Smood"
    }
    "fav_color": "blue"
    "languages": [
        {
            "name": "Chinese"
            "level": 10
        }
        {
            "name": "English"
            "level": 8
            "preferred": true
        }
        {
            "name": "Japenese"
            "level": 6
        }
    ]
    "height": 180
    "weight": 68
}


# Set data.
jdb.exec
    data: some_data
    command: (jdb, data) ->
        jdb.doc.ys = data
        jdb.save 'saved'
    callback: (err, data) ->
        console.log data # output >> saved


# Don't do something like this!
wrong = ->
    jdb.exec command: (jdb) ->
        # Error: the scope here should not access the variable `some_data`.
        jdb.doc.ys = some_data
        jdb.save()


# Get the value.
jdb.exec
    command: (jdb) ->
        jdb.send jdb.doc.ys.name
    callback: (err, data) ->
        console.log data # output >> [ "Yad", "Smood" ]


# You can even load third party libs to handle with your data.
# Here we use the JSONSelect and Mongodb like sift to query data.
jdb.exec
    command: (jdb) ->
        try
            { match: jselect } = require 'JSONSelect'
            sift = require 'sift'
        catch e
            console.error '"npm install JSONSelect sift" first!'
            return

        jdb.send {
            JSONSelect: jselect(
                    'number', jdb.doc
                )
            mongodb_like: sift(
                    { level: { $gt: 8 } }, jdb.doc.ys.languages
                )
        }
# Here we use promise to get the callback data.
.done (result) ->
    console.log result.JSONSelect   # output >> [ 10, 8, 6, 180, 68 ]
    console.log result.mongodb_like # output >> [ { name: 'Chinese', level: 10 } ]

```

# Http server quick start

To allow JDB to serve multiple clients, you can start it as a http server.

Install `jdb` globally.

    npm install -g jdb

See help info.

    jdb -h

Start server at port 8081.

    jdb -p 8081

JDB action `exec` only accepts raw `json` http request (do not url-encode the body!). For example:

    POST /exec HTTP/1.1
    Host: 127.0.0.1:8081

    { "data": 10, "command": "function(jdb, data) { jdb.doc.a = 1; jdb.save(jdb.doc.a); }" }

It will return json:

    {"a":1}

JDB action `compact_db_file` example:

    GET /compact_db_file HTTP/1.1
    Host: 127.0.0.1:8081

It will return:

    OK


# API

## class Jdb

* ### constructor (options)

      * **options**

         * **db_path**

           Where to save the database file. Default value is `jdb.db`.

         * **compact_db_file**

           Boolean. Whether to compact db file before start up or not. Default true.

         * **promise**

           Boolean. Whether to enable promise or not. Default false.

         * **error**

           The error handler when initializing database.

* ### exec (options)

  `options` is an object, here are its member list.

  * **data**

      `data` should be serializable object. It will be send with `command`, see the `command (jdb)` part.

  * **command (jdb)**

      A function or corresponding source code.
      The code in this function is in another process.
      You can't share variable within it.

      #### jdb

      An object from which you access the functions of the database. Here's the list of its members.

      * **data**

         The `data` object that sent from the `exec (options)`.

      * **doc**

         The main storage `Object`.

      * **save([data])**

         When your data manipulation is done, call this method to permanent your change. It will auto call the send for you.

         * **data**

             The same as the `data` of `jdb.send`.

      * **send ([data])**

         Send data to the `callback`.

         * **data**

             Type is `Object`. Only the serializable part of the object will be sent.

      * **rollback()**

         Call it when you want to rollback the change that you made.

  * **callback (err, data)**

     This function will be invoked when the `send` function is called asynchronous.

      * **err**

         Type is `Object`.

      * **data**

         Type is `Object`.


* ### compact_db_file (callback)

  Reduce the size of the database file. It will calc all the commands and save the final `doc` object to the file and delete all the other commands.

* ### compact_db_file_sync ()

  The sync version of `compact_db_file (callback)`.


# Benchmarks <a name='benchmarks'></a>

To run the benchmark:

    `cake benchmark`

### JDB on Intel Core i7 2.3GHz SSD

* insert x 15,719 ops/sec ±3.03% (76 runs sampled)
* query x 123,143 ops/sec ±1.52% (81 runs sampled)

### MongoDB on Intel Core i7 2.3GHz SSD

**JDB is much faster than MongoDB**

* insert x 3,744 ops/sec ±2.63% (76 runs sampled)
* query x 2,416 ops/sec ±3.89% (70 runs sampled)

### Redis on Intel Core i7 2.3GHz SSD

**JDB's query performance is 12 times faster than Redis**

* insert x 10,619 ops/sec ±2.33% (77 runs sampled)
* query x 10,722 ops/sec ±2.27% (80 runs sampled)

### JDB on Digitalocean VPS 1 CPU

**Even on a much slower machine JDB is still much faster than MongoDB**

* insert x 7,286 ops/sec ±2.77% (77 runs sampled)
* query x 43,240 ops/sec ±3.07% (78 runs sampled)

Though for MongoDB and Redis, most of their CPU time is ate by their DB adapters, but I think
for some small projects, such as personal blog, or a non-cluster application, the adapter issue
should also be taken into consideration.

# Road Map

* More fault tolerance support. Such as file system error handling.

* Remote interface.

* Maybe simple cluster support.
